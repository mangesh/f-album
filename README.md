View/Manage Facebook Albums
================================================================================
> Small application to manage your facebook albums

This is a small/sample application to show/view/manage your facebook albums
in easy and smart way.
Features of this application:
* 0.1.1 Update Readme and remove `echo` and `include` in place of a proper
  rendering.
* 0.1.0 Backwards compatibility breaking - Reorder the parameters on the
  `get()`, `post()` and http testing methods to be in the new order of
  `$this->$method($path, $formVars, $optionalHeaders);`. This makes the testing
  a little more terse, and clears up any confusion with improved parameter
  names.
* 0.0.9 Bug fix for [issue 4][issue4], with thanks to origal for his work in
  solving a problem with get parameters.
